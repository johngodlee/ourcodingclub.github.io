## Stream overview

Ecological data are messy... We study a range of organisms and processes through varied study designs like long-term monitoring and factorial experiments, and most of the time usual statistical assumptions don't hold because the data we collect are not independent. 

But fear not, environmental scientist! This course stream is designed to give the more experienced R user* an overview of the things to consider in choosing and fitting a model, and to explore a wide range of statistical models, from mixed-effects models to ordination studies, time-series analysis, and more, with the option to branch out towards different programming languages to best suit your needs. 

We assume you have a good understanding of the different objects in R and can manipulate them, for instance for plotting or inclusion in linear models. Need a refresher? Take a look at the tutorials in our [Stats from Scratch]({{ site.baseurl }}/dl_course/stats-scratch/index.html) or [Wiz of Data Vis]({{ site.baseurl }}/dl_course/wiz-viz/index.html) course streams.

## As part of this course stream, we suggest you do the following tutorials:

* [Efficient data manipulation: Streamline your code]({{ site.baseurl }}/tutorials/data-manip-efficient/index.html)
* [Intro to functional programming: loops & custom functions]({{ site.baseurl }}/tutorials/funandloops/index.html) 
* [Intro to model design: pick the right model for your questions]({{ site.baseurl }}/tutorials/model-design/index.html) 
* [Ordination: finding patterns in data]({{ site.baseurl }}/tutorials/ordination/index.html) 
* [Intro to mixed-effects linear models]({{ site.baseurl }}/tutorials/mixed-models/index.html) 
* [Intro to Bayesian inference with MCMCglmm]({{ site.baseurl }}/tutorials/mcmcglmm/index.html)
* [Generalised mixed-effects models in Stan]({{ site.baseurl }}/tutorials/stan-2/index.html)

## Getting started

We hope you enjoy doing the course! There is no time limit for completion, so you can take it at your own pace. Each tutorial might take you between one and three hours to complete, and your completion will be recorded once you take the quiz at the end.

You can download all the materials for this stream from our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ourcodingclub/CC_course_stream3).

If you are not yet registered for the course, visit our [info page]({{ site.baseurl }}/dl_course/) to sign up.

You can track your progression and access the course quizzes in our course portal.

## Challenge yourself

Have you completed all the tutorials you wanted to? Feel you're ready for some real-life applications? We encourage you to test your skills and take the challenge associated to this stream.

Our case-study challenges are designed to test the range of skills you gained throughout the course. We provide guidance but no step-by-step instructions, so your solution will be unique! A challenge might take you 4-8 hours to complete (get in touch if you get stuck!). The button below will take you to the challenge page where you can see what is required.
