Coding Club is almost a year old! Time has flown by, many lines of code have rolled in, and we have gathered quite the collection of <a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/" target="_blank">tutorials on our website!</a> It has been so wonderful to meet people keen to advance their quantitative skills and learn more about coding! It's a special kind of magic when people come together to share their knowledge, and we are thrilled that we will be keeping the magic going! Welcome week at The University of Edinburgh is over, and we are all set to start our workshops again!

This year, we want to aim further, and we are hoping to extend our network of collaborators. We are planning to lead workshops in St Andrews, Aberdeen and more, and we are looking forward to having people from other institutions come lead workshops here as well.

<b>If you are passionate about statistics and programming, and would like to share your knowledge - please get in touch with us at ourcodingclub@gmail.com - we would love to have more people contribute tutorials! We are happy to help you with preparing your tutorial and will provide the support you need. Perhaps you could lead a Coding Club workshop at your institution and us here in Edinburgh can complete it online. Maybe you could even come visit us - we will gladly discuss opportunities!</b>

Coding Club has become a big part of our lives, and we are thrilled to see it having a positive impact on other people's lives as well! We are looking forward to meeeting new students, solving more R errors and coming up with smart ways to code more efficiently!

The Coding Club team has been all over the world for the summer holidays - the Canadian Arctic, the Republic of Congo, Wales and more - we have been fortunate to see beautiful places and conduct exciting fieldwork - now it's time for data analysis, which would be all the more fun with Coding Club workshops along the way.

We are thrilled to be supported by a <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/institute-academic-development/learning-teaching/funding/funding/previous-projects/year/march-2017/coding-club">Principal's Teaching Award Scheme</a> grant, and are full of inspiration and motivation!
