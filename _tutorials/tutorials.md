## Tutorial Aims:

1. [Get familiar with the Coding Club model](#demo)
2. [Write your own tutorial](#tutorial)
3. [Publish your tutorial on Github](#publish)

## Key steps

Each step is explained in detail as you start going through the workshop resources below. Have a quick read. There is no need to click on links or download things right now, this is just an outline so that you know what is ahead of you. You can use this list as a reference to track how far through the workshop you are.

__Part 1: Becoming familiar with the Coding Club model.__

Step 1. Individually or in small groups, complete [a brief Coding Club tutorial]({{ site.baseurl }}/tutorials/popchange/index.html) about quantifying and mapping vertebrate population change in Europe.


__Part 2: In small groups, create your own tutorial.__

Step 1. Choose a topic for your tutorial from the list weâ€™ve collated Each demonstrator will help out the group that has chosen the topic they contributed.

Step 2. Download the tutorial template file `tut_template.md` and the `R` scripts for the various tutorials from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/ourcodingclub/CC-EAB-tut-ideas) (click on Clone/Download, Download Zip and unzip the files).

Step 3. Open the `R` script for your chosen topic, run through the code to get familiar with what it does and save any plots it generates.

Step 4. Open `tut_template.md` in a plain text editor on half of your screen. Keep `RStudio` and the `R` script on the other half of the screen.

Step 5. Follow the template and instructions to create your tutorial. You need to copy the code from the `R` script to the template fle, add text to explain what your tutorial does and add the plots.

Step 6. Save your completed template file as `index.md`.

Step 7. Create a new repository on GitHub and upload `index.md` and your plots. Go to Settings, enable GitHub pages and you are done! Your tutorial is now live at the link thats shows up in the GitHub pages settings panel!

{: #demo}

__We started Coding Club to help people at all career stages gain statistical and programming fluency, facilitating the collective advancement of ecology across institutions and borders. We use in-person workshops and online tutorials to equip participants not only with new skills, but also with the means to communicate these new skills broadly via online tutorials.__

__We would love to extend Coding Club beyond the University of Edinburgh and create a supportive community of people keen to get better at coding and statistics! With that in mind, we present you with a workshop on how to write and share tutorials!__


![Aberdeen Study Group logo]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/tutorials/tutorials/74b26610-2027-11e7-841b-f91777fdfcdf.png)

There are similar initiatives already in place, which is very exciting! For this workshop, we are thrilled to be collaborating with the [Aberdeen Study Group](https://aberdeenstudygroup.github.io/studyGroup/), led by [Francesca Mancini](https://francescamancini.github.io/). The Aberdeen Study Group aims to foster a place where people can get together to work on their coding projects, help each other out and share their work, whilst also learning new skills. You can follow their adventures in coding and open science [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/abdnStudyGroup).

## How does a Coding Club workshop work?

There are many ways to run a coding workshop and different approaches might work better in different situations. Here is how we usually structure our workshops. The workshops take two hours and begin with a super short presentation or introductory talk about what we will be doing, what skills we will acquire and what they are useful for. We then direct workshop attendants to the link for the tutorial around which the workshop is focused. People usually open the tutorial on half of their screen and `RStudio` on the other half.

![Coding Club Desktop diagram]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/tutorials/tutorials/workshop.png)

At each workshop, we have a team of demonstrators who are there to answer questions and help out. We find that it works well to let people go through the tutorial at their own pace and we usually walk around and check whether things are going fine. Most of the tutorials have challenges at the end, for which people can work individually or in small teams. We bring cookies, popcorn and other treats, occasionally make bad R jokes and try our best to make the atmosphere light and positive. We don't require people to sign up and there are no obligations to attend all the workshops: people are free to attend whichever workshops are of interest to them. At the end of the workshops, we usually stay behind for a while in case people have any specific questions about their own coding projects.

## Find out for yourself - complete a quick Coding Club tutorial

#### To get a taste of the Coding Club experience, you can complete a [Coding Club tutorial on mapping vertebrate population change across Europe.]({{ site.baseurl }}/tutorials/popchange/index.html)

{% include figure.html url=link caption="Anseriformes populations in Europe." %}

## Write your own tutorial
{: #tutorial}

__Next we will learn how to write, format and publish coding tutorials.__

We write our tutorials in Markdown. Markdown is a language with plain text formatting syntax. Github and Markdown work very well together and we use Markdown because we can turn a Markdown file into a website hosted on Github in a minute or so! Because of the syntax formatting, Markdown is a great way to display code: the code appears in chunks and stands out from the rest of the text. All of the Coding Club tutorials are written in Markdown.

We use the Atom text editor, which is a user-friendly text editor and easy on the eyes. You can use another text editor, like Brackets or TextEdit on a Mac and Notepad on a Windows computer if you prefer, the principle is the same. A plain text editor is a programme, which allow you to create, save and edit various types of text files, like `.txt` and in our case, Markdown (`.md`) files. So for example, `Microsoft Word` is a text editor, but not a plain one. In the "fancier" plain text editors, you get "syntax" highlighting: different types of text, like code and links, are colour coded so they are easier to spot.

__You can [download Atom here, if you wish.](https://atom.io/)__

![Atom and RStudio screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/tutorials/tutorials/atom_rstudio.png)


Our workflow tends to go like this:

- Write the `R` code for the tutorial in `RStudio`
- Save any graphs you create with your code
- Open `Atom`, copy and paste your `R` code in a new file
- Save the file as a `.md` file, e.g. `datavis.md`
- Add text to explain the purpose of the tutorial and what the code does
- Add images and links as suitable


__Don't worry if you've never used `Atom` or `Markdown` before. We have created a template you can open straight in Atom (or another plain text editor) and just insert your text, comments and images.__

You can download the `tut_template.md` file that you can turn into a tutorial from this [Github repository](https://github.com/ourcodingclub/CC-EAB-tut-ideas). Click on Clone/Download Zip, download the files and unzip them.

__Open the file `tut_template.md` in Atom. The file includes instructions on how to add subheadings, links, code and images. We have prepared a few sample topics based on which you can write a brief tutorial. Please choose a topic by clicking on it, which will take you to all the files necessary to write the tutorial.__

Here is a list of the sample topics you may choose to arite a tutorial on:

* [Mapping Arctic fox occurrence records](#polar_map)
* [Plotting the spatial clustering forest trees due to elephants](#forest_plots)
* [Creating a density map of red squirrel occurrences](#density_maps)
* [Visualising daily temperature fluctuations](#temp_timeseries)
* [Graphically summarising plant trait data](#plant_traits)
* [Visualising photosynthetic activity within sunflecks](#sunflecks)
* [Analysing paths of movement and spatial autocorrelation](#movement)

# Publish your tutorial on Github
{: #publish}

__Next we can publish our tutorial on GitHub, which will turn it into a website, whose link you can share with your peers - transferring quantitative skills among ecologists in action!__

__Go to the GitHub website, register if you don't already have an account (it's free) and click on `New Repository`.__

![Create a new Github repository]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/tutorials/tutorials/new_repo_eab.png)

Choose a name for your repository: that will form part of the link for your online tutorial so choose something short and informative. Add a brief description, click on `Initialize with a README.md` and then click on `Create repository`.

![Add a description to a new Github repository]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/tutorials/tutorials/new_repo_eab2.png)

#### Now you can see your new repository. Click on `Upload files` and upload your filled in `Markdown` template. Make sure you save the file as `index.md` - that will make your tutorial the landing (home) page of the website. Upload any images you are using in your tutorial as well.

You are two clicks away from having a website with your tutorial! Now click on `Settings` and scroll down to the `GitHub pages` section. We need to enable the `GitHub pages` feature, which turns our `index.md` file into a page, i.e. website. Change `Source` from `None` to `master` - the master branch of our repository. Click on `Save`.

![Github change repo source to Master]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/tutorials/tutorials/github_pages.png)

#### Congratulations, your repository is now published as a website!

__Scroll down to the `GitHub pages` section again - you can see the link for your tutorial! If you need to edit your tutorial, you can go back to your repository, select the `index.md` file, then click on `Edit` and make any necessary changes. You can also check out different themes for your website, though the default one is clean and tidy, which works well for coding and statistics tutorials in general.__

__We would love to see your tutorials - feel free to share them with us on Twitter __@our_codingclub__ or via email __ourcodingclub@gmail.com__

### Contribute a tutorial

__Are you keen to share some of your coding and statistics knowledge? We would love to have more people join our team and build a world-wide community of people teaching and learning together! You can take a look at the tutorials we have already developed. Feel free to make suggestions for changes on existing tutorials and get in touch with us at ourcodingclub@gmail.com if you would like to make a new tutorial.__

### Useful resources

You can also make a website with multiple pages, rather that having a single page (your `index.md` file). That's how we've made the [Coding Club website]({{ site.baseurl }}) and the [Aberdeen Study Group website](https://aberdeenstudygroup.github.io/studyGroup/).
