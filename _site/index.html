<h2 id="about-us">About us</h2>

<p>Our team includes undergradute students, graduates, PhD students and lecturers. We are all passionate for good teaching and improving quantitative skills. We believe that coding can be really fun and also understand the importance of quantitative skills for professional development.</p>

<p>We organise weekly workshops, complemented by <a href="/tutorials/">online tutorials</a>.</p>

<p>Coding Club is for everyone, regardless of their career stage or current level of knowledge. We want to create a jolly and diverse community where everyone has a voice and feels comfortable to express it. Our own team includes people from different backgrounds and nationalities and we are happy to be working together. We want to establish the same ethos within Coding Club as a whole: Coding Club is a place that brings people together, regardless of their gender or background. We all have the right to learn, and we believe learning is more fun and efficient when we help each other along the way.</p>

<p>Our mission is to create a diverse learning community where we help each other to attain fluency in statistics and programming. If you would like to join us or learn more, please email <strong>ourcodingclub@gmail.com</strong>. You can also check out <a href="http://www.teaching-matters-blog.ed.ac.uk/?p=1129" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our blog post on peer-to-peer teaching</a> on the Teaching Matters blog.

<h2 id="funding">Funding</h2>

<p>Coding Club was jumpstarted with support from an <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/development-alumni/iig" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Innovation Initiative Grant</a> from the Edinburgh Fund at the University of Edinburgh. We organised our first joint workshop with the University of Aberdeen with the help of a GESA Innovation Initiative Grant. We are now taking Coding Club further with the help of a <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/institute-academic-development/learning-teaching/funding/funding/previous-projects/year/march-2017/coding-club" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Principal’s Teaching Award Scheme grant</a>. We are working together with the <a href="http://e3dtp.geos.ed.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NERC E3 Doctoral Training Partnership</a> which supports two of our team members (Gergana and John).</p>
